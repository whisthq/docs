<h1>Webserver Responsibilities<a class="headerlink" href="#webserver-responsibilities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The Fractal Webserver performs three main functions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Controls which users have access to which compute resources</p></li>
<li><p>Makes sure we have enough compute for the userload we’re seeing, by starting and stopping cloud instances</p></li>
<li><p>Allows users to initiate application streams – i.e. to start using Fractal</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="access-control">
<h2>Access Control<a class="headerlink" href="#access-control" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For each access token that the Fractal Webserver receives, it must verify that the authenticated user is authorized to access
the resources to which they are requesting access. For example, some Fractal Webserver resources are only accessible to
Fractal subscribers, while others are only accessible to Fractal administrators. Access tokens are JWTs issued by an Auth0
tenant that takes care of user management and authentication. Each time the Fractal Webserver receives one of these access
tokens, it uses the Auth0 tenant’s public signing key to validate the token’s signature. Validating the signature allows the
Fractal Webserver to trust that the token was really issued by the Auth0 tenant. Once the signature has been validated, the
Webserver can use the data contained in the token’s payload to determine whether or not the authenticated is authorized to
access the resource to which they are requesting access. In order to enforce access control for resources that are only
accessible to Fractal subscribers, the Fractal Webserver reads the the authenticated user’s Stripe-issued customer ID from
the token’s payload and uses it to query Stripe’s API for the authenticated user’s Fractal subscription status. If the
subscription is in one of the “active” or “trialing” states, they are granted access to the resource. In order to enforce
access control for resources that are only accessible to Fractal administrators, the Webserver reads from the token’s payload
the API scopes that the user is authorized to access. If one of those scopes is “admin”, then the user is allowed to access
the resource.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="compute-scaling">
<h2>Compute Scaling<a class="headerlink" href="#compute-scaling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Fractal Webserver continuously keeps track of the amount of load on our system, both in terms of the number of active
users and their actual activity level. Based on this, it starts and stops cloud instances dynamically in order to make sure
everyone who wants a session can have one, ideally without any wait.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="application-streaming">
<h2>Application Streaming<a class="headerlink" href="#application-streaming" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>By far the most significant and complicated of the Fractal Webserver’s responsibilities is that of allocating Fractal
containers to users. When the Webserver receives a request to start streaming an application, the web server must quickly
procure connection information for a running instance of the Fractal Protocol Server and return it to the the Fractal
Desktop application that requested the streaming session.</p>
<div class="section" id="starting-streams">
<h3>Starting Streams<a class="headerlink" href="#starting-streams" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>At a high level, when the Fractal Webserver receives a request to allocate a Fractal container to a user, from which an
application stream will begin. It does the following in order:</p>
<p>1. Check for any idle Fractal container that may have been created in advance in order to minimize the amount of time taken
to return an application stream connection information to the client. If any idle Fractal container exist, choose one,
return its connection information to the client, and skip to step 3.
2. Start a new Fractal container on a cloud instance with availability, and return its connection information to the user.
3. Scale the pool of idle Fractal containers based on current idle Fractal containers supply and application stream
demand metrics, creating new cloud instances as necessary.</p>
<p>In order to reduce the amount of time it takes for the Fractal Webserver to associate an instance of the Fractal client with
an application stream, we “cache,” as it were, some information about the cloud resources that are provisioned and available
to serve Fractal containers. Although it is redundant for us to take it upon ourselves to store some of this information
because we could just as easily obtain it with a query to AWS, in practice it is advantageous to do so because querying
our own database is quicker than querying AWS.</p>
<p>Another reason why it is useful, if not necessarily necessary, to cache some information about what cloud resources are
available to serve application streams is that we have implement our own scaling layer on top of what scaling AWS already
provides. Specifically, there is code on the Fractal Webserver that both scales the number of ECS clusters we have made
available to ourselves for the purposes of deploying containerized application streams and also load balances application
streams across all of these clusters.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ending-streams">
<h3>Ending Streams<a class="headerlink" href="#ending-streams" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When a user closes a streamed application at the end of their streaming session, the Fractal container running this
application notifies the Fractal Webserver that the user has disconnected. At this point, the web server instructs AWS to
delete the container. All data except for any application-specific configuration vanishes. In other words, every streamed
application (i.e. Fractal container) has an ephemeral hard drive. All data that is persisted between streaming sessions is
encrypted with a user-specific encryption key and uploaded to in AWS S3 before the Fractal container destroys itself. The
encryption key is known only to the end-user, so neither AWS nor Fractal employees are able to decrypt and read the users’ data.</p>
