   A description of the other internal and external services with which the
   Fractal webserver communicates.

Other Services
==============


User Agents
-----------

The Fractal Desktop Applications allow customers to register and log into user accounts. Once a Fractal Desktop Application
is authenticated, it requests that the Fractal Webserver allocates it a Fractal Container, at which point a 
streaming session can begin. Developers use tools such as web browsers, Postman, and cURL to perform manual tests against 
instances of the Fractal Webserver, and also to perform administrative actions like creating and deleting cloud resources.


Fractal Host Service
--------------------

The Fractal Host Service is responsible for orchestrating container allocation and interaction on a host machine. 
It listens for connections from the Fractal Webserver, which periodically sends commands and data that influence how and when 
containerized application streaming sessions start and run to the Fractal Host Service on a specific host machine. It is also 
responsible for handling properly setting up Fractal Containers and their interaction with the host, notably via allocating 
TTYs and Uinput nodes. The Fractal Host Service also sends periodic heartbeats back to the Fractal Webserver to let it know 
that it is alive.


Fractal Protocol Server
-----------------------

The Fractal Protocol Server is responsible for handling the server-side part of the streaming, and is installed in Fractal
Containers. It notifies the Fractal Webserver when connected clients disconnect, so that the Fractal Webserver knows when
to tell AWS to delete instances/containers that are no longer needed.


GitHub Actions Workflows
------------------------

Each time a new release is deployed, a GitHub Actions workflow places the Fractal Webserver in maintenance mode so that the
deployment can happen atomically. It is necessary to suspend normal webserver operation temporarily (during which users won't
be able to request new connections, but existing connections will not be impacted) when deploying new releases so that the 
system has time to programmatically update all of our cloud infrastructure to that of the new release.


HireFire
--------

HireFire is a Heroku add-on that is responsible for scaling our Celery worker processes. The HireFire service periodically 
requests scaling metrics from the Fractal Webserver. It uses these metrics to determine the desired number of Celery worker 
processes to run and scales the actual number of running Celery worker processes accordingly.


Databases
---------

On startup, the Fractal Webserver reads from a centralized database of Flask configuration variables, the `fractal-config`
database, that may be overridden by Heroku environment variables. We call this database the configuration database and it is 
shared by all Fractal Webserver deployments, mainly `dev`, `staging` and `prod`. Each Fractal Webserver deployment is also 
attached to an all-purpose PostgresSQL database that it uses at runtime. This database keeps track of streaming sessions that 
have been initiated by API requests to the associated Fractal Webserver.


AWS Services
------------

The web server is responsible for scaling cloud resources. In particular, it interacts heavily with AWS EC2 and with AWS ECS. 
Specifically, the Fractal Webserver has a utility library interface over the AWS EC2 API that allows us to provision and 
deprovision cloud resources from Python code easily. Containers are then handled directory by the Fractal Host Service on the 
instance. We use this utility library when scaling up (adding more) or scaling down (shutting off) EC2 instances due to 
periods of lower or higher load. Once active, these instances are interfaced with via the Fractal Host Service (see above) 
rather than directly via the EC2 API whenever possible. This invariant is only violated when the Fractal Host Service is 
malfunctioning, at which point the utility library is used to directly shut down instances.


Stripe
------

The Fractal Webserver is responsible for associating Stripe customers with Fractal user accounts managed via Auth0, managing 
subscriptions, and granting or denying users service based on their subscription status. We use Stripe to handle all of our
payments infrastructure and it interacts closely with Auth0, which handles all of our authentication infrastructure.
