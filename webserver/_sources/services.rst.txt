   A description of the other internal and external services with which the
   Whist webserver communicates.

Other Services
==============


User Agents
-----------

The Whist Desktop Applications allow customers to register and log into user accounts. Once a Whist Desktop Application
is authenticated, it requests that the Whist Webserver allocates it a Whist mandelbox, at which point a 
streaming session can begin. Developers use tools such as web browsers, Postman, and cURL to perform manual tests against 
instances of the Whist Webserver, and also to perform administrative actions like creating and deleting cloud resources.


Whist Host Service
--------------------

The Whist Host Service is responsible for orchestrating mandelbox allocation and interaction on a host machine. 
It listens for connections from the Whist Webserver, which periodically sends commands and data that influence how and when 
application streaming sessions start and run to the Whist Host Service on a specific host machine. It is also 
responsible for handling properly setting up Whist mandelboxes and their interaction with the host, notably via allocating 
TTYs and Uinput nodes. The Whist Host Service also sends periodic heartbeats back to the Whist Webserver to let it know 
that it is alive.


Whist Protocol Server
-----------------------

The Whist Protocol Server is responsible for handling the server-side part of the streaming, and is installed in Whist
mandelboxes. It notifies the Whist Webserver when connected clients disconnect, so that the Whist Webserver knows when
to tell AWS to delete instances that are no longer needed.


GitHub Actions Workflows
------------------------

Each time a new release is deployed on protocol, a GitHub Actions workflow triggers the following steps.

#. Builds the AMIs with the updated version of protocol.
#. Invokes the flask cli bundled along with the webserver to create preconfigured buffer capacity.
#. Once the instances are up with with the newer AMIs, we atomically switch over from the older AMIs to newer AMIs across all regions.


HireFire
--------

HireFire is a Heroku add-on that is responsible for scaling our Celery worker processes. The HireFire service periodically 
requests scaling metrics from the Whist Webserver. It uses these metrics to determine the desired number of Celery worker 
processes to run and scales the actual number of running Celery worker processes accordingly.


Databases
---------

On startup, the Whist Webserver reads from a centralized database of Flask configuration variables, the `whist-config`
database, that may be overridden by Heroku environment variables. We call this database the configuration database and it is 
shared by all Whist Webserver deployments, mainly `dev`, `staging` and `prod`. Each Whist Webserver deployment is also 
attached to an all-purpose PostgresSQL database that it uses at runtime. This database keeps track of streaming sessions that 
have been initiated by API requests to the associated Whist Webserver.


AWS Services
------------

The web server is responsible for scaling cloud resources. In particular, it interacts heavily with AWS EC2. 
Specifically, the Whist Webserver has a utility library interface over the AWS EC2 API that allows us to provision and 
deprovision cloud resources from Python code easily. Mandelboxes are then handled directory by the Whist Host Service on the 
instance. We use this utility library when scaling up (adding more) or scaling down (shutting off) EC2 instances due to 
periods of lower or higher load. Once active, these instances are interfaced with via the Whist Host Service (see above) 
rather than directly via the EC2 API whenever possible. This invariant is only violated when the Whist Host Service is 
malfunctioning, at which point the utility library is used to directly shut down instances.


Stripe
------

The Whist Webserver is responsible for associating Stripe customers with Whist user accounts managed via Auth0, managing 
subscriptions, and granting or denying users service based on their subscription status. We use Stripe to handle all of our
payments infrastructure and it interacts closely with Auth0, which handles all of our authentication infrastructure.
